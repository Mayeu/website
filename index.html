    "FinTech applications, regardless of whether they are centralized or decentralized, <br>
    are putting new demands on WoT and identity by virtue of creating highly profitable <br>
    targets for attackers. Resisting these attacks requires ecosystem wide code signing <br>           practices, and in turn PGP usage, far beyond what is currently practiced."</i>

    "The web-of-trust that began in Pretty Good Privacy was more than 'pretty good' in <br>
    1991 and even in 2001. However, as we approach the 25th anniversary of PGP, it is <br>
    time to take the lessons we've learned and the new cryptographic technologies we've <br>
    created to take a fresh look at the problem. I'm looking forward to collaborating to <br>
    create a new foundation for next 25 years of the web-of-trust." </i>

<a id="workshop-purpose" class="anchor" href="#workshop-purpose" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workshop Purpose</h3>

<p>This facilitated design workshop is concentrated on creating the next generation of decentralized web of trust-based identity systems. The goal of this event is to generate 5 technical white papers on topics decided by the group that will have the greatest impact on the future, followed by a hackathon early in the new year to implement those ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Topics include:</strong> hierarchical identity keys, perfect forward secrecy, self-validating script in certifications, unbundling certification from revocation, attribute certificates, selective disclosure, multisig+group+ring signatures using Schnorr, reputation and trust metrics.</p>

<p>This two day event is intended for developers, cryptographers, and research-related staff who are heavily involved in building the current infrastructure of web of trust tools.</p>
<p>Experienced cryptographic, cryptocurrency and identity technology developers are the core of contributors to this event. Others participants include researchers working in the fields of security and cryptography at large. Additional participants are also welcome to <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/tree/master/topics-and-advance-readings"></a>submit a paper</a> in advance of the DesignShop for a possible invite. At a minimum we expect familiarity with cryptographic identitity technologies (both traditition PKI such as certificate authorities and web-of-trust technologies like PGP). Open Source content will be the primary source material for this workshop.</p>
