<p>This facilitated design workshop is concentrated on creating the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. The goal of this workshop is to generate 5 technical white papers on topics decided by the group that will have the greatest impact on the future.</p>
<p><strong>Topics include:</strong> hierarchical identity keys, perfect forward secrecy, self-validating script in certifications, unbundling certification from revocation, attribute certificates, selective disclosure, multisig+group+ring signatures using Schnorr, reputation and trust metrics, etc.</p>
